{"title":  "Monkey menace goes nowhere despite tall poll promises", "content": "Farmers say shrinking cultivation and expanding forest cover around abandoned land have unintentionally increased monkey habitats and worsening the human-wildlife conflict. Local production of traditional crops has declined, and some farmers have shifted to less risky crops or seasonal work outside agriculture. The growing human-wildlife conflict mirrors patterns reported in hill districts across Nepal, where wildlife conservation successes have sometimes increased pressure on farming communities without adequate mitigation measures. As the House of Representatives polls approach, monkey menace has been a major election agenda in Dhankuta, a hill district in Koshi province. Election candidates have once again made monkey control a campaign issue, promising fencing, compensation schemes, and stronger wildlife management policies."}
